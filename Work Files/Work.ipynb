Job Satisfaction Across Departments: Although our test didn’t show a significant difference between IT and HR, it’s worth looking into job satisfaction across other departments and demographic groups. There could be specific teams or age groups that feel less satisfied, and addressing these differences is critical for overall employee morale.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Work-Life Balance vs. Engagement: The negative correlation here raises some important questions. Why are employees who have a good work-life balance not feeling more engaged? We recommend conducting additional surveys or interviews to understand what's missing. Perhaps the organization could focus on offering more opportunities for professional development, recognition, or creating a more stimulating and motivating work environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Areas for Improvement: In addition to job satisfaction and engagement, there may be other factors affecting employee experience, such as compensation, career growth opportunities, or management support. Further analysis and more comprehensive feedback from employees will help identify specific areas for improvement.\""

Additionally, exploring why work-life balance is negatively correlated with engagement could provide even more actionable recommendations for improving employee experience."
